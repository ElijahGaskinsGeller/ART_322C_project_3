# ART_322C_project_3

## Ideas:

    - animation should be subtle
        - no major movement.
    - water swaying
    - seagull standing looking arround
    - sealions relaxing
    - flag waving
    - boats rocking in the water
    - sunrise / early morning
    - buildings to the east
    - ocean to the west
    - cars passing by in the distance
        - no people
    - low framerate
        - less frames / higher res imgs
        - works better for the lazy feeling
    - maybe another dock can be seen in the distance with a person sitting on it
        - playing guitar
        - based on otis redding
    - instrumental of song playing in bg

    - cell or flat shaded with simple line art
        - lines have a simple displacement on them to give feeling of movement
    - chaos from the city and calm from the pier/water
        - there should be a feeling that sitting there is the most important thing
